##### Expected Start/End Times #####

**Start Date**: June 2018  
**End Date**: December 2018

#####  Project Preview #####
A simple project in which I will have multiple input fields in order to save my contact information of friends/family. This will be saved into a database which will be able to be called upon and sorted by category. 

Example Categories:
1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Address
4. Birthday
5. Category (Friend/Family/etc)
...Category could also be a custom field, in which the user creates a class to be attached on a entry to entry basis. Then its added to a hotlist of categories that can be pre-selected from a drop down on subsequent entries.

#####  Guidelines #####
Will be using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS for the basic setup and the programming of the features. For database, I am leaning towards MongoDB, though since I dont have a good understanding of databases at this point I might have to change this in the future. I might also need to create a login/out feature as well for this in order to utilize the database. Will update this later as I learn more.

#####  Todo List #####
1. Create very basic drawing of layout
2. Create basic html/css of entries
3. Create basic functionality with JS

Will add more details once the project is more thought out.
